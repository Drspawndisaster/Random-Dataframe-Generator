# Generates a random pandas dataframe
I used it for testing and making different kinds of graphs when I was learning how to use pandas. Now I'm learning how to use github, so it's useful even now.

Instructions: Put how long you want the data frame to be, a min and a max for the randomly generated numbers, and a start value. You don't have to because they all have fairly reasonable default values, but you can.

#UPDATE: I just learned that this is actually pointless and is already a part of numpy. So, yeah...
